            <h3>Automated Fare Collection and Dynamic Stop Notification System for Time Efficient Bus Operations</h3>
            <p>This patent document presents a novel system for automated fare collection and
                passenger management in public transportation, designed to optimize efficiency
                and enhance passenger experience. The system integrates various components
                to streamline fare payment processes and improve operational workflows.
                Upon boarding, passengers tap their smart cards to a module that records their
                boarding position and other vital information. This data is simultaneously kept in
                local and global databases. The local database updates the driver&#39;s display in
                real time with passenger counts, available seats, and forthcoming bus stops that
                require passengers to alight, allowing for more informed decision-making. In
                addition, the system prioritizes accessibility by allowing passengers with
                disabilities to pre-book, with drivers receiving early notice. Passengers swipe
                their cards once again for fare deduction while deboarding at their destination. If
                a card is not tapped during the deboarding process, there will be a penalty that
                will be taken out of the card during the next trip.To ensure fare compliance in the
                
                event of inadequate capital, fares are subtracted from the minimum deposit made
                for the card. GPS units also monitor bus movements, which improves operational
                supervision and route optimisation. This integrated system is expected to
                optimize bus operations in urban transportation networks, boost accessibility, and
                streamline passenger management.</p>
